# About Me

I am currently employed as a software development manager for Oracle. I consider myself extremely fortunate to work with some of the brightest developers on a daily basis. Even though the majority of my time is spent managing others, I write as much code as I can, when I can.

I run [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) with [Xmonad](http://xmonad.org/) as the windows manager. If you're unfamiliar with tiling windows managers, I recommend checking them out.


## My Loves
- Python
- Vim
- Anything with a terminal interface

When I'm not at work, I'm either writing code, watching soccer, or writing code while watching soccer.

## Some Random Thoughts
- When it comes to coding, I believe in going fast and breaking things
- Unit testing is the best thing since sliced bread
- I hate "Agile". Not Agile as a methodology but the fact that its principles have become something that are followed blindly by masses of middle and upper management that are incapable of thinking for themselves
- I love Vim and wish I could say I hate Emacs but I honestly don't know enough about it. At least it isn't gedit.
- Somehow, I've managed to become the only software developer that hates working on a Mac. I spent one week coding on a Mac and it was awful.
