# Zen and the Art of Unit Testing
## Why don't programmers like nature?

Some developers seriously underestimate the value of writing tests. Design decisions in code are important but how we test those decisions is just as important.

When I introduce my developers to the concept of test writing, they sometimes struggle with it. Some may even become frustrated because they feel that testing should be simple or the concepts should be easy. I believe this to be false. I always explain to my developers that good test writing should be considered an art form. It really does take a fair amount of practice to get good at it.
