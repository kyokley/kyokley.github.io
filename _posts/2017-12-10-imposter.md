# Imposter Syndrome: Fake It Til You Make It

Imposter syndrome is the belief that, regardless of all evidence to the contrary, you don't belong. This can lead to developers second guessing themselves, remaining silent when they probably shouldn't, and having their confidence undermined.

Over the years I've spent in software development, I have struggled with this constantly and I am far from alone. For those not in the industry, it can be hard to understand how this is possible. Even trying to introspect into my own head has been difficult at times. I'm hoping that with this post, I can shed some light on things and maybe sort out my own thoughts.
