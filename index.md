# Welcome to 2's Complement

### A work in progress...
My goal for this page is to be a place for me to collect my thoughts and possibly showcase some of the things I'm working on. As such, this site may be in a constant state of flux. Check back often!

## How I work
Below are repos that contain the various config files for my development environments
- [Dotfiles](https://github.com/kyokley/dotfiles) (These are a collection of general configs)
- [NeoVim](https://github.com/kyokley/nvimRepo)
- [Vim](https://github.com/kyokley/vimRepo) (I mostly use NeoVim exclusively now so this repo is not actively updated.)
- [Prezto](https://github.com/kyokley/prezto)
